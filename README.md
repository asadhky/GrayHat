Run it the same way you run the initial project as specified by the Google Doc.

Install first with: npm install
Then run: npm start

The Doc did specify it works well with node v16.16.0, but mine worked on node v16.19.1.

Explanations:
1. Changed Mario's skin multiple times, but ended with the brick from the sprite pack as it provided for an interesting visual.
2. The timer now goes up from 0, rather than going down from 180.
3. Inverted the key commands, and now Mario moves inverted.
4. Gave a pitch black background to signify night, and changed the clouds for bigger and more realistic ones,
5. Changed the Game Over sound to the victory sound, it lasts for a while.

Didn't have time to attempt the bonus questions as I started the assessment late (I have a day job).
